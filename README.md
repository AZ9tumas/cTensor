# cTensor
 
This is the prototype of a lightweight neural network library written in C11.

This repo contains a `main.c` which is an example of how to use the library.
In this example, we are building a simple neural network with `linear` and `relu`.
This neural network is trained to learn from the "iris dataset".

The example is runable, but the result is not correct because the math operators have not been
implemented yet. If you are a student who is applying this project, please try to fix the math operators and make `main.c` work correctly.
